A VSTS dashboard widget to display a project's 7 day build overview pie chart. The widget will look at all build configurations in a project. Not just one. Other than that, there's not a great deal else to say really. Always wanted to display the build pie chart on a project's home page on the dashboard? Then this dashboard widget is for you.
